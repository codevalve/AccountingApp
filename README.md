# AccountingApp

## An application used to explain OOP and Design Patterns.

## The Solution

It may seem odd to start with the solution first, but I think it will illustrate the goal of of this tutorial.

The premise in this AccountingApp is that we as developers often support an application we've written for a long time. There will be many changes over time and being able to support those changes efficiently lies within our ability to adapt, refactor, maintain and mentor. Yes, I said mentor. I've seen brilliant COBOL developers struggle with areas of OOP and Design Patterns. I've been pained to watch CS Majors write linear code when I expected them to at least have had some proper OOP in the class room. Again these are very smart people, so why do they do they do things the "hard way". (It's not wrong, but it sure makes your life as a coder more difficult.) The simple answer is that they just haven't been exposed to a real world use for these concepts. How do you transfer Animal.CanBark() to RateEngineStrategy.Calculate(rentalDate,hours,discountCode). Inheritance is tricky and all to often misused. Examples are too simple and lack any connection to the real world. I thought that was what OOP was intended for; to model the real world in objects. In my thirty plus years as a programmer, I have never been given a requirement by a bank or flight simulator company to make their system bark.
